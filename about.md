## Hey! I'm Katie Cunningham.

I am currently the Computer Science Education Coordinator at Cal State Monterey Bay and Hartnell College. I work closely with students from the Salinas Valley to ensure they obtain the education they need to compete for top opportunities in software engineering and other computing careers. I have developed and currently manage many programs to achieve this goal, including [TA++](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/taplusplus/), [Peer-Led Team Learning](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/cs-pltl/what-is-pltl), and [Cohort Enrichment](https://sites.google.com/a/csumb.edu/fys-cs/).
